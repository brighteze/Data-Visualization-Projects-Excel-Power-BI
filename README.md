# Project 1. MS Excel Project (Financial-Complaints-Dashboard)
This is a dashboard project featuring an organizations complaints handling mechanism. The data shows all complaints, for what products, and channels. I built this simple dashboard using Microsoft Excel. The dashboard is a record of complaints by customers of a financial institution.

Data is from data.world, with the title "financial consumer complaints".

Techniques used in this project;

- Power Query to clean the data.
- Power Pivot, for cross tabulations and filtering.
- Excel charts for data visualization.

Here are some insights from this project:

- Web channel was the most frequently used for complaints resolution.
- Most complaints came from customers in California.
- Credit card was the product with the most complaints.
- Over 80% of complaints resolved without monetary compensation.


# Project 2. MS POWER BI Project (Visualizing Sales Performance)
In this project, I have built a dashboard to visualize the sales performance of an online store, using various metrics, such as;
- Aggregate monthly sales performance within the time period of 2015-2019
- Sales, Profit and product returns over the period.
- Sales performance by Product Category & Sales personell.
- Sales Performance by Segment, and
- Sales by customer.

Here are some insights from the analysis and dashboard.
- Total sales came up to $2,300,000 and profit was $286,400 - representing about 12%.
- On aggregate, the highest sales was recorded in September, November & December.
  - This could be down to shopping activities related to festive seasons such as black friday (November) and Christmas.
- Sales appreciates steadily and took a nosedive in 2019, on further investigation, I found that data collection in 2019 was not completed.
- On overall, Anna Andreadi and Chuck Magee were the best performing Sales Personell.
- Consumer segment was the best performing product segment with over 50% of total sales.
- Top customers were Sean Miller, Tamara Chand and Raymond Buch.
