# MS Excel Project (Financial-Complaints-Dashboard)
This is a dashboard project featuring an organizations complaints handling mechanism. The data shows all complaints, for what products, and channels. I built this simple dashboard using Microsoft Excel. The dashboard is a record of complaints by customers of a financial institution.

Data is from data.world, with the title "financial consumer complaints".

Techniques used in this project;

1. Power Query to clean the data.
2. Power Pivot, for cross tabulations and filtering.
3. Excel charts for data visualization.

Here are some insights from this project:

1. Web channel was the most frequently used for complaints resolution.
2. Most complaints came from customers in California.
3. Credit card was the product with the most complaints.
4. Over 80% of complaints resolved without monetary compensation.
